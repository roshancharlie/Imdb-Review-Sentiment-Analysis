0,"Most of the reviewers for this film here on IMDb appear to be folks of Indian background; nothing wrong with that but with most of them offering glowing praise and a '10 rating, it's difficult to get a true perspective on the movie. I thought it was OK, though not a '10' rated film by any means. The picture utilizes a tried and true sports movie formula depicting a rigorous training schedule, a demanding coach and notable accomplishments along the way before the principal character encounters some roadblocks on the way to a Commonwealth Games gold medal. There's also the idea of success achieved by defying conventional thinking, in the way Geeta Phogat (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and her sister Babita (Sanya Malhotra) rise to prominence in the traditionally male sport of wrestling. That's perhaps the film's best takeaway, as the girls in question endured a lot of physical and mental anguish to achieve their goals, thereby serving as role models for other young women to follow.","Most of the reviewers for this film here on IMDb appear to be folks of Indian background; nothing wrong with that but with most of them offering glowing praise and a '10 rating, it's difficult to get a true perspective on the movie.

1,"Let this incredibly sincere biopic wrestle with your emotions, let it grab you around the waist and smash you through a glass ceiling like no other, let it hold you in its arms and flip you around until your head is spinning. A truly inspirational story of a family, of Geeta Phogat and her sister Babita Kumari, of their father Mahavir Singh Phogat, of the incredible journey, adventure and experience they undertake in order to achieve something spectacular and profound. With breathtaking performances all round, this is one film that will leave you in awe of the incredible things people can achieve in the most challenging of circumstances - an absolutely astonishing piece of film making.","Let this incredibly sincere biopic wrestle with your emotions, let it grab you around the waist and smash you through a glass ceiling like no other, let it hold you in its arms and flip you around until your head is spinning.

2,"I saw this with my family in a theatre. Awesome experience.
Aamir's acting, effort n most importantly his passion is what makes his cinema so damn unique. First thing Dangal has going for it is Aamir khan.
Aamir khan gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Phogat. He is the best actor in bollywood. Period. He shocked me by his transformation. I myself being a gym trainer knows the effort which goes in such kinda transformation. Without Aamir I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has.
The child actors were good too. The music was good. The direction by Tiwari was the best of 2016. This movie was never boring and full credit shud go to the director. The cinematography gave you a feeling as if what you are watching is real.
Overall you don't have to like wrestling or know wrestling to appreciate this movie. Its a wonderful movie. The movie is written very well. Superb screenplay n crispy editing.","I saw this with my family in a theatre. Awesome experience. Aamir's acting, effort n most importantly his passion is what makes his cinema so damn unique.

3,"DANGAL is a masterpiece. A terrific film that stays in your heart and remains etched in your memory much after the screening has concluded. A brilliant film that restores your faith in Hindi cinema. Actually, it won't be erroneous to state that DANGAL is the finest film to come out of the Hindi film industry in a long, long time and mark my words, it will be remembered as a classic in times to come. It blends drama, emotions, sportsmanship and patriotism extraordinarily the icing on the cake being Aamir Khan's towering act. This rich-in-merits film has a major advantage too -- the holidays ahead Christmas and New Year -- which will ensure a glorious run at the ticket counters. A must, must watch!","DANGAL is a masterpiece. A terrific film that stays in your heart and remains etched in your memory much after the screening has concluded.

5,"If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.","If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies.

6,"Director Mr. Nitesh Tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes, you just forget that you are watching film. You simply start witnessing the journey of Phogat's family. Makers are so confident that they have even given credit for story idea to Divya Rao, which reflects their honesty. She is not in writing team but gets her due credit. There are four writers, Director himself, Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain and Nikhil Mehrotra and their work is fantastic. Screenplay is seamless and very balanced with much needed freshness. Film starts with glimpse of Mahavir Singh Phogat's passion for wrestling, while watching and challenging another district level arrogant winner, while commentary comes over on them which is fresh. When that person gets defeated he says 'Tumne district level pehlawan ko haraya hai' Then Mahavir Singh replies ' Tension mat le, tum national level champion se hare ho'. Words may be a bit different but meaning was same. Which gives strong idea that what level of dialogues you are going to listen and they have maintained the graph. Dialogues just nourish your senses, inducing correct emotions. A simple scene where protagonist massages feet of his sleeping daughter, clearly reflects that he is just not a ruthless coach but a caring father too. Girls curse their father in front of their friend who is getting married, then that girl emotional words about her feeling towards their caring father is very cute, emotional and enough to make girls realize that what they are taking for granted. Best part of this film is it's continues ascending graph in every aspect. First half is cute, funny with subtle dose of emotions. Second half takes this graph to the horizon. Full of emotions, either it is of defeat, victory or relations. Another major plus point is the way they have shown wrestling. I dint know a bit of it but I enjoyed all wrestling matches like it was my favorite game and that is major chunk of film. Hats off to the team behind wresting choreography .Though you have basic idea of film happenings but still they kept you engrossed by presentation. Climax comes with a very strong message that one can train you but only you have to implement the techniques, which makes you true winner and enriches self confident. Performance makes you thunderstruck. Words can not justify or compliment, Amir Khan's performance as Mahavir Singh Phogat. Zaira Waseem as younger Geeta is brilliant. She is so good that when Fatima Sana Sheikh takes over as grown up Geeta, you miss younger one but soon Fatima proves that she has taken the graph far ahead. Same happens with younger Babita played by Suhani Bhatnagar and grown up by Sanya Malhotra. Skashi Tanwar as wife of Mahavir Singh is very good. Girish Kulkarni , who had played coach is superb, you do hate his character but love his performance. Actor, who played younger cousin of Geeta and even grown up one, both actors are cute and endearing. Kudos to casting director Mukesh Chhabra and team. Music by Pritam and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya, are integral part of this film. Without any formulated track you just enjoy every song and your eyes get mois in one too.","Director Mr. Nitesh Tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes, you just forget that you are watching film.

7,Aamir Khan shines in the role of Mahavir Singh Phogat. He is so outstanding in his performance that this could be considered as one of his best works ever. The opening scene of the film is just a glimpse of Phogat's passion for the sport – wrestling. The first half of Dangal works exactly like a skilled wrestler – invariably sure of its moves. The film's second half is all about victory. Mahavir's transformation from the once upset father of a baby girl to the most triumphant one to Geeta's string of losses before she finally wins a gold during Common Wealth Games to desi akhara being replaced by wrestling mat – every moment works in contrast to what you had watched earlier. But not even once does the film loses its focus.,Aamir Khan shines in the role of Mahavir Singh Phogat.

10,"Dangal has Indian box office record of all time and it deserves it. It is the best biopic Bollywood can make. It has every quality Hollywood biopics have. Cast did an amazing job. Preparing this project as an actor is hard. Aamir Khan's transformation proves that. They brilliantly show us their characters' moods and reactions about every event they have been through. Also, Dangal has great descriptions about public and important social messages. I really respect that. I think it is almost a masterpiece but it miss that by a step. Best thing this movie have is showing us great character motivations and relationships. They made it nicely. Worst thing this movie have is telling wrestling's technical details so superficial. It shows something about that but it doesn't explain.","Dangal has Indian box office record of all time and it deserves it. It is the best biopic Bollywood can make.

11,"DANGAL - its such a good thing that both PINK and DANGAL , two top movies of this year are women centric. Its such an improvement for Bollywood which doesn't make movies on women because such movies doesn't make money , which is a wrong fact , PINK made almost 300% profit. You just need to make a good movie and it will make you money. And by saying women centric m serious, the character of Mahavir Phogat is not the real hero of the movie , rather its his daughter Geeta Phogat who is in the center of the movie. For understanding what MAhavir Phogat has achieved in his life , we must know the fact that Hariyana is one of the worst state in India for girls. A very low sex ratio and a very low Literacy rate for women. And in such scenario what Mahavir Phogat has achieved is tremendous. That said , one thing is clear that we cant expect anything out of the box which we always get from AMIR's movies like 3 idiot , PK and TALAASH , because its a biopic , so they have to show what actually happened , which is not exactly bad things , in fact what this movie shows is an out of the box real life story. First i would like to mention two things which i don't liked. 1st - The way the wrestling coach of NATIONAL SPORTS ACADEMY has been shown as one sided villain also who is kind of incapable to train , was wrong. 2nd - there was an unnecessary twist in the end which seems unconvincing. Apart from these two things , everything else is either good or great in the movie. The movie tackle through different themes. Sometimes it tackles them one by one , and sometimes simultaneously. But the good thing is that it tackles them convincingly. For example when we see Mahavir training his daughters rigorously , there comes a thought that, what kind of dad he is. He just stole the childhood of her daughters to fulfill his own dreams. But after some scenes on the wedding of Mahavir's daughters' friend both the daughters complaining about Mahavir her friend (who is getting married) reply that she hoped that she would had get such father as Mahavir who thinks about their daughters and wants them to achieve something and not like his own father who force her to marry at the age of just 14 to an unknown person. That particular scene convince the audience that what Mahavir is doing is not wrong as compared to the society where they are living. Another theme which movie showed very convincingly was how free a girl feel when she goes out of his family for the first time. Almost 1 hour of the movie contains wrestling matches. And those matches were done extremely well on technical level , and hook you like you were watching a real match. I mean as compared to this the matches show in SULTAN were just nothing. Among the performances ZAIRA WASIM (also the lead actor of Amir's next SECRET SUPERSTAR) playing Young GEETA was delight to watch. The scene where she request her father to not cut her hair and she will do anything he wants was heartbreaking. And she does her fighting scenes very well considering the fact that the director in an interview has mentioned that ZAIRA was actually the weakest among all the four girls before they start their training. But when it comes to fight scenes , FATIMA SANA SHEIK as the older Geeta was best. She fights like a real fighter and her hard work is visible on the screen. On her dramatic acting front she was awesome too. Both the actresses who played young and old Babita were good too , but got less screen time as compared to Geeta's character. Aparshakti Khurana(brother of Ayushman Khurana) as the nephew of Mahavir has an impeccable timing of comedy , and surly will make you laugh many time. But for Amir Khan , what to say , he blends so nicely , that he became MAHAVIR , and the actor Amir is nowhere visible anywhere. He just makes me wonder why cant other actors (yes pointing at SRK and SALLU) stop-showing their persona and blend into characters in their movies . Around the whole movie there were so many whistle blowing happening , that i was not able to here the dialogues many times. But just before climax , the NATIONAL ANTHEM runs in common wealth games after GEETA PHOGAT won her gold medal(i hope that's not a spoiler) and the whole theater stands in respect of NATIONAL ANTHEM you just cant help and get OVERWHELMED. 9.4/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR","DANGAL - its such a good thing that both PINK and DANGAL , two top movies of this year are women centric.

15,"It's conceivable that a wrestling movie might have you on the edge of your seat, but who'd have thought it would bring tears to your eyes. Dangal does both in large doses. Right from the opening scenes through to the awesome climax, this is one movie that will keep you glued to the screen. I can't remember the last 3 hour movie (nearly) where absolutely nobody took a toilet break apart from in the intermission.","It's conceivable that a wrestling movie might have you on the edge of your seat, but who'd have thought it would bring tears to your eyes.

16,"Dangal (9/10) is the kind of film for which the 70mm medium exists. It has universal appeal, is technically brilliant and more than anything else it is a film that skillfully balances popular sentiments and realism.

17,"Aamir Khan is back after 'pk' as a wrestler who wants his daughter to win the Gold for the nation. It is a biopic of Mahavir Phogat. And believe me, it's a must watch biopic to get inspiration.

18,"Nitesh Tiwari, Amir Khan and the team has put an extra-ordinary effort to make such an intelligent blend of Inspiration, Emotions and Humor that standing ovation at the end is irresistible. Dangal has a very unfamiliar high level of detail which is too good for Bollywood. High detailing make actors live the character, which doesn't go unnoticed and Dangal proves this point. Each actor wasn't just playing the character, they were truly living it. It was the Phogat family viewers saw on screen instead of the actors. That makes Dangal stand out. Acting is brilliant by both the lead and supporting actors. Mr. Perfectionist was great like always. No words to describe his level of commitment. Special mentions are the debutantes Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra and Zaira Waseem. All the wrestling scenes are perfect and viewers can't mistake them for actors. The way these girls portrayed the characters of the wrestlers Geeta and Babita is commendable and worthy of every award. Story was based on a true story and the director stuck to it with some slight additions to make the movie more emotional and enjoyable which is good for Bollywood audience. But as a critic I must say there was a little bit of over dramatization in the end. Also I want to mention that AK and Nitesh didn't include any usual romantic crap and dance sequences which must be appreciated. Casting could have been better. Fatima is too cute for Geeta's character and this matters a lot while making a Biography. But she minimized this shortcoming by her flawless performance. Movie is 2hr40mins long but its well crafted so its enjoyable. ____________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ Its a must watch movie and Amir Khan keeps on setting standards for other producers of Bollywood which makes us hope for a better future of movies in India.","Nitesh Tiwari, Amir Khan and the team has put an extra-ordinary effort to make such an intelligent blend of Inspiration, Emotions and Humor that standing ovation at the end is irresistible.

19,"Umm where to start? First of Aamir sir has done it again. He really has a good taste in selecting movies. Not only the acting even the fighting scenes were quite real to me & reel Geeta and Babita were just too awesome. There is certain moments where you're gonna laugh out loud, get anger, get emotional and obviously feel proud the most that's what the movie brings out of itself. I hope this movie brings joy to all family and a chance to look at all daughter's of their's potential.","Umm where to start? First of Aamir sir has done it again.

20,"Dangal (means a Wrestling Competition), a biopic on Phogat Sisters Geeta and Babita and their father Mahavir Singh Phogat, by Nitesh Tiwari is a triumph over odds. Geeta made history by being the first Indian female wrestler to win the Gold medal (55kg) and Babita won Silver medal (51 Kg) in 2010 Commonwealth games. Offlate, Bollywood has certainly made a few very good sports biopics viz. Chake de, Bhag Milkha Bhag, Mary Kom, M.S. Dhoni etc. Most of them have done justice to the players and their lives. It is true that films about real heroes can become predictable. The story telling needs to be authentic too without misconstruing the essence. And that is where Dangal scores like anything. It is unadulterated, and remains true to the core.

Being a sport genre film, you will know what will transpire in the final climatic scene from a mile away, but it does hit all the usual tropes and emotional beats with verve and aplomb. The good ones in this genre know how to make the arduous learning journey resemble inspirational life lessons and will also make you feel vested in the story.

27,"Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal is highly gripping and transitions smoothly from being a sports drama to an emotional one. The inspiring tale of Mahavir and his daughters is narrated in such a way that you laugh, cry and at some point even make sure you root for these characters right till the end.The father-daughter relationships between Geeta and Mahavir and Babita and Mahavir are explored extremely well emotionally. Also, how situations change the ties between the two sisters has been tapped into well.DANGAL is a flawless piece of work -- it's captivating, unpredictable, spellbinding, entertaining and never overstays its welcome. I rate 5/5 for 'Dangal' and Aamir's best performance since Lagaan.","Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal is highly gripping and transitions smoothly from being a sports drama to an emotional one.

Pour in cinematography, location, songs & meaningful lyrics. Voila! Everything amazingly fits together in a single string. Truly clean entertainment. In all sense of the word. Worth watching with family. A good movie should entertain. A great movie must connect. And connect, it did. I could almost feel as if I were there, throughout. The plot development is deep, and engaging. Did I mention the child actors, especially the one portraying Geeta? Outstanding performance by all. In a nutshell, my time & resources spent were fully worth. And Aamir Khan! Boy, he never disappoints. =)","Just came home after watching the premier show. It really is a masterpiece!

31,"Amir Khan a person always amazes everyone,recently he is working for movies with a good moral lesson and a worthy base.That kind of movie is a ""movie"". Dangal is a good example it has a classic taste and digestible fun which peels off the people eyes. It is a true story full of suspense and when you're watching a fight you feel like you are wrestling in between this kind of quality is difficult to be produced and Amir is good at it. The reason for giving 9 stars is because of its ending I think it should be made better by showing scene like he is putting that medal at the wall of Honor. Anyways keep it up I was expecting this a thing from you. Love you :)","Amir Khan a person always amazes everyone,recently he is working for movies with a good moral lesson and a worthy base.That kind of movie is a ""movie"".

32,"Beautiful and heartfelt story told in dynamic way with down-to-earth and humorous narrative by adorable cousin. 'Dangal' runs more than two and a half hours, but it never feels long or dragging because it contains clear plot development, up-and-downs, and climax & resolution. Wrestling sequences are interesting and realistic at the same time. I do not even like wrestling, but scenes in the movie capture the attention and build the tension and intensity. Many action scenes, hand-to-hand combat scenes, or sporting event sequence feel like an interruption to the story-building because they are unnatural and obviously planned for camera purpose. I can just guess, but actors must have practiced hard to make the movement as their own. Finally, AWESOME music. It is traditional and trendy at the same time.","Beautiful and heartfelt story told in dynamic way with down-to-earth and humorous narrative by adorable cousin.

34,"Powerfully emotional and inspiring, Dangal is an excellent sports film that should probably be in the top 10 sports movies of the world. I was actually able to predict nearly every part of the ending, and predictable movies usually aren't able to pull an emotional response from me. Dangal was different, making me eagerly await the predicted final scenes, and I was still fighting back tears when the scenes finally came. With that said, the second act did lull by making one of the characters less likable for far too long. Also, I wasn't a fan of the father playing favorites in most of the second half. So it's not a perfect movie, but the first act was pure fun and the third act was powerfully inspiring, and it's surely worth a watch.","Powerfully emotional and inspiring, Dangal is an excellent sports film that should probably be in the top 10 sports movies of the world.

43,An Aamir Khan film is special. It's an event that happens once every two years or once a year if we're lucky. We've come to expect excellence from a man who can go from playing a college student to an alien to now an aging overweight former wrestler with such pure passion and dedication that you're left wondering if there's anything Mr. Khan can't dobut we already know the answer to that question. He pours his blood and sweat into each project and I truly believe that no other individual in the Indian film industry understands the pulse of their audience as well as Aamir does.

46,I am a big fan of Aamir Khan and I watch all his movies. Aamir sets a high expectation bar for his movies in all departments. Dangal also had a high bar to climb and it did so with aplomb. Aamir chose a great subject of encouragement for female wrestlers in India. Against all odds Mahavir Singh Phogat decides to train his daughters in wrestling to win a gold medal for India. Movie's casting was excellent with all actors doing so well in their characters. Aamir was great as usual but I was really impressed by how well the four girls did as growing wrestlers. They were strong and they were agile and they owned the court they were in. I am sure there were some technical help provided in shooting all those wrestling scenes but you will not be able to tell that while watching the movie. Their scenes were authentic and you were rooting for them as they were gritting their teeth and fighting tooth and nail to defeat their opponents. Dialog delivery in Haryanvi was on the money and you really will come out thinking that these actors speak that way everyday. I am not going to provide any spoiler but will just say that this is a movie to watch. It is a shame that release of such a beautiful movie had to be delayed by more than a year because of political fear.,I am a big fan of Aamir Khan and I watch all his movies.

47,Its a movie decked up with the classic acting of the veterans and the novices and bore the testimony of the unorthodox approach to bring to light the dream of Mahavir Phogat. The fire of 'dangal' ignited in the hearts of the sisters which paved the path of demolition of gender discrimination. The film portrays the affectionate bonding of a father and a daughter and emotional rendition escalates barriers when the elder sister has kept the very words of her father's dream. In fact it is beautifully carved that our ignorance towards our family elders hinders our progress. The film has been peppered with humour every now and then and it has added extra spice to the viewers.,Its a movie decked up with the classic acting of the veterans and the novices and bore the testimony of the unorthodox approach to bring to light the dream of Mahavir Phogat.

48,"Yes, this is about girl power in the precise sense of muscle power. But is it about girl power? I mean the two daughters of a man who wanted boys do what is perceived as a boy sport to win for their loser father who was unable to reach the top spot. If the father would have had boys, there would be no girl power. If they would have failed, the story would have been precisely the same, yet no motivational girl power despite all the time and energy invested. So it's about women acting in accordance with the will of a man to satisfy the man. I failed to see the feminism.","Yes, this is about girl power in the precise sense of muscle power.

So it's about women acting in accordance with the will of a man to satisfy the man. I failed to see the feminism."

Director Nitesh Tiwari & Aamir team up to tell The affecting true-story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari, to their eventual triumph.

50,"Mahavir Singh Phogat is a passionate wrestler who is a national champion and dreams of getting gold for India. The passion to get a gold for India spans over a generation. His journey to make his daughters win medals is crafted very well. His dream gets fulfilled because of his daughter Geeta, who also wins first gold for India and thus becomes source of inspiration for millions of girls.Another thing I liked is the way it educates rules of wrestling I did not had any know how previously. A very nice flawless, and inspiring movie in short.","Mahavir Singh Phogat is a passionate wrestler who is a national champion and dreams of getting gold for India.

51,"I got the privilege to watch this film earlier than the India release as I happen to live in North America. Thank you Disney! Now, what to say about 'Dangal'? It's not a typical Bollywood film, yet it is easily the best Bollywood film ever, even in terms of every, so called, Bollywood masala trick. The incredible storytelling, based on true events, every small detailing, amazing cast, the message it had without being preachy or pretentious but still powerful-there was not one single boring moment in the movie-well, probably one, if you are too picky!,though it is nearly three hours! Kudos to the director! And what to say about Aamir khan? Though he did not have any dramatic moment in the movie (those belong to the girls, who were fabulous by the way), he is not the charming usual boy next door, sexy or cheeky person(the traits which are generally associated with Aamir Khan); rather he is a brute, has a tummy for the majority length of the movie-yet you will not be able to keep him off your mind, even after the movie ends, and easily the best Aamir khan performance ever (and yes, I have seen every Aamir khan film, each a million time).","I got the privilege to watch this film earlier than the India release as I happen to live in North America.

An impressive journey, the one that leaves an impact.

Coming for our Director #Nitish ,he is just all perfect, he has taken Bollywood to the next height,he brought the wrestling scenes so engaging that for once I though I was watching the Live match, from #chillar party to #bhootnath to #dangal ,his work is just flawless . The #babita's character by #Suhani & #Sanya & #Geeta's by #Fatima and #Zaira was also mind blowing, still I liked the young geeta and babita more, best scenes were those where they used to get frustrated of the Khusti(wrestling). Nothing to say more, because for me it's an Oscar winning. So,our 2016 started with #Wazir and ending with #Dangal...

Just last week, I saw a 30 second trailer where Mr. Aamir Khan's character has a dialogue with his office colleague while watching a wrestling match. And that included Mr. Aamir slamming a man twice his size on the floor with perfect form. I knew I had to watch this movie and erase the negative mindset that had been created because of Sultan the clown.

Director Nitesh Tiwari's ""Dangal"" is the back story of two sisters, Geeta and Babita's claim to fame in the international wrestling arena. The story starts with their Father Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former National Champion in Wrestling, who nurtures the aspiration that one day his to be born son will fulfill his unfulfilled dream. The dream of bringing gold medal for the country in an international event. But destiny had other plans and the couple were blessed with girl children for four consecutive times.

72,"While I understand Aamir khan is just an actor who is portraying a role, I find it highly hypocritical that he does TV shows like satya meva jayate, the essence is to fight for human rights and equality of gender. It is so disgusting how 9.5 out of 10 Indians like this movie without realizing how a failed wrestler is enforcing his will on to his innocent girls. I get it girls can do whatever boys can do ideology but this is not about equal rights this is about free- will. A human be it a girl or a boy has a right to live his or her life without someone telling them what to do with their lives. I wanted to be a doctor but i turned out to be a successful software engineer, I do well with my life but I'm not satisfied. Point is Indian society is succumbed to the idea of do what parents tell you, your life is like a car driven by your parents, what you really want to do doesn't matter in most cases. This ideology has to change. Like how will Smith in pursuit of happiness says to his ""don't ever let tell you what to do with your life, if you want to be something just go get it"". We should let kids achieve whatever they want to achieve rather than enforcing your will into the kids. I know a lot of people will not understand my stance, I'm hoping someone rational understands the point and let their kids achieve their own dreams not the parent's.","While I understand Aamir khan is just an actor who is portraying a role, I find it highly hypocritical that he does TV shows like satya meva jayate, the essence is to fight for human rights and equality of gender.

77,"Very rare one would come across a film that leaves a lasting impression. That not only entertains but also empowers. A film that compels each & every person in theatre for a standing ovation. Dangal is one of its kind film. While watching this awe-inspiring film I cried, laughed, cheered & became spellbound. Based on an incredible real life story of Mahavir Singh Phogat & his daughters Dangal strikes a Gold. It outshines in every department of film making. From very first scene Dangal stays focused to its story thus helping viewers attention remain clinged to the essential theme of the film; i.e Wrestling.The opening credit is a spectacular ode to the game with the close- up shots of the Wrestlers in Akhadas. Daler Mehandi's thundering voice from the background added more to its brilliance. The strength of Dangal lies in its treatment of storytelling. It never glorifies any of its characters unnecessarily. We are introduced to a gloomy faced Aamir Khan with unfulfilled aspirations and then succumbed to circumstances forcing him to take up a Govt job.No extravagant entry scene. From this very point you know that you are seeing the National Champion Mahavir Singh Phogat, not the superstar Aamir Khan. The actor as we know him, never fails to amaze us. He did not actually play the character. He lived it. A performance of life time. I believe if this film was made in Hollywood, Aamir Khan would surely be given an Oscar. Though we are quite familiar with Aamir's style of method acting but the other cast of the films have equally given a stupendous performance. Fatima Sana Sheikh, Sanya Malhotra, Suhani Bhatnagar, Zahra Wasim, Apashakti Khurana, Sakshi Tanwar everyone acted convincingly maintaining the authenticity in accent, body language & dialogue delivery. The girls in lead really worked hard. Their commitment & dedication was clearly visible in the wrestling scenes. Not for a single moment they made us feel that they are not professional wrestlers. Dangal is also an eye-opener for biopic film makers in India. Previously I have seen in Mary Kom,Priyanka Chopra acted the whole film without knowing properly how to punch! This is where lies the difference. Dangal also soars high as a matured sports film. Never before any Bollywood films has shown the sports technicalities in minute details. Dangal is a winner all the way. Kudos to director Nitesh Tiwari. It takes immense courage & strong vision to helm such a project. And once again credits to the Santa Claus of Indian cinema- Aamir Khan for being the flag-bearer of 'Meaningful Entertainment' & gifting us the most wonderful cinematic experiences. Dangal is definitely one of the best films ever made.","Very rare one would come across a film that leaves a lasting impression. That not only entertains but also empowers.

78,"Review by AJ. In cinemas now: ""DANGAL"" MUST SEE, at least 2 or 3 times ! One of the most beautiful and bold films made by one of the jewels of India, mr Aamir Khan. It's such a loving and touching film about making a dream come true. To endure hardships and pain, to hold on to the trust, faith and innerstrength. Especially for women, not only in India, but all over the world, there's more to Life than the responsibility of the kitchen & family. Women have so much potential, if every woman would live her dream and exploit her own talents, can you imagine how fast forward this world would become. It's not about competing with men, or slaying them. It's about the real power women possess. What they can give to the world. And second it's about the delicate (and strong at the same time), the father-daughter relationship, the tears, the love, the hard life-lessons, seeking his approval, trying to say sorry when pride gets in the way (such a heartbreaking scene). I promise you, your tears will come straight from the heart, cause every girl has gone through this moment in her Life.. It has such an impact on the thoughts of men and women. There is no doubt anymore. It is proved, a woman can achieve what she wants, so no more excuses. But you have to be ready to go beyond the boundaries, conquer your fears, confront yourself, accept your weakness, be greedy enough to taste the victory. You want it so bad, you are willing to give up what you cherish most about yourself. But more important you must be able to distinguish what is good for you and what is bad. Cause pride can make you do things that are horrid to your character, it is not you and it is no part of your dream. But it is the lesson you have to learn on the path to becoming the champion. Becoming the winner you already are. To become a wrestler, one has to be stripped down from all thoughts one has had till now. And learn from a different source of knowledge and that's where the powerful father also guru steps in. He can mould her, but she has to do the job. It's not easy to get up at 5 am and go jogging in the fields, but if you are focused you will do it. If it means you can't eat all the sweet and tasty meals you used to eat, you will make the decision to not eat them. There's the difference, no compromise, it's just a yes or no, that simple, cause that will make you the winner. Some people are meant to be great, they work harder than anyone else. To make his dream come true, the father, Mahavir (even his name is great) changed his mindset. Men and women are equal, that's what he believed (unlike a lot of other people). He's a man who is a true man from the core. His respect for Life, for his parents, for his medal, for his lovely family, it's so grand. His daughters are his pride and strength. And if he says something, you can bet it will touch your heart and mind. He's so powerful without being rude or disrespectful. He's the ultimate teacher ! And he is right about the fact that sport in India has no support from the government. Cause if they would create a department for sports only, can you imagine how many medals India would win in all those world-competitions. So many talents are wasted as we speak, sporters settle down for a job, cause they have to eat, one can't eat a medal. The fight-scenes are exquisite in quality, you can actually hear and feel bones being cracked and crushed, muscles being tightened and bodies being slammed to the ground. It's Shakti-power all over the place. The songs are heartwarming and daring, it's tough to be a girl in a man's world and have the heart of a Lion, be strong as a bear and sharp as an eagle. Thank you Aamir Khan, once again, in making this world a better place, showing us the path to positivity and progress !","Review by AJ. In cinemas now: ""DANGAL"" MUST SEE, at least 2 or 3 times ! One of the most beautiful and bold films made by one of the jewels of India, mr Aamir Khan. It's such a loving and touching film about making a dream come true. To endure hardships and pain, to hold on to the trust, faith and innerstrength. Especially for women, not only in India, but all over the world, there's more to Life than the responsibility of the kitchen & family. Women have so much potential, if every woman would live her dream and exploit her own talents, can you imagine how fast forward this world would become. It's not about competing with men, or slaying them. It's about the real power women possess. What they can give to the world. And second it's about the delicate (and strong at the same time), the father-daughter relationship, the tears, the love, the hard life-lessons, seeking his approval, trying to say sorry when pride gets in the way (such a heartbreaking scene). I promise you, your tears will come straight from the heart, cause every girl has gone through this moment in her Life.. It has such an impact on the thoughts of men and women. There is no doubt anymore. It is proved, a woman can achieve what she wants, so no more excuses. But you have to be ready to go beyond the boundaries, conquer your fears, confront yourself, accept your weakness, be greedy enough to taste the victory. You want it so bad, you are willing to give up what you cherish most about yourself. But more important you must be able to distinguish what is good for you and what is bad. Cause pride can make you do things that are horrid to your character, it is not you and it is no part of your dream. But it is the lesson you have to learn on the path to becoming the champion. Becoming the winner you already are. To become a wrestler, one has to be stripped down from all thoughts one has had till now. And learn from a different source of knowledge and that's where the powerful father also guru steps in. He can mould her, but she has to do the job. It's not easy to get up at 5 am and go jogging in the fields, but if you are focused you will do it. If it means you can't eat all the sweet and tasty meals you used to eat, you will make the decision to not eat them. There's the difference, no compromise, it's just a yes or no, that simple, cause that will make you the winner. Some people are meant to be great, they work harder than anyone else. To make his dream come true, the father, Mahavir (even his name is great) changed his mindset. Men and women are equal, that's what he believed (unlike a lot of other people). He's a man who is a true man from the core. His respect for Life, for his parents, for his medal, for his lovely family, it's so grand. His daughters are his pride and strength. And if he says something, you can bet it will touch your heart and mind. He's so powerful without being rude or disrespectful. He's the ultimate teacher ! And he is right about the fact that sport in India has no support from the government. Cause if they would create a department for sports only, can you imagine how many medals India would win in all those world-competitions.

79,"I believe this film teaches us wrong things. Basicly, the father forces his daughters to do his dream, to win a gold medal for a country, because he himself wasn't good enough to do it himself. Secondly, supposedly even silver is not good enough for the father. What kind of father is that, he's lucky his daughters are cable of all that but with all this he could've not only mentally damages both of his daughters but ruin their life too. He gave them no free will of what they want from life, he forced them to live their whole lives how he wanted them to be.","I believe this film teaches us wrong things.

80,"If you think Dangal is another textbook biography flick, I reckon you will be surprised with the entire flick from head to the toe. Dangal is a masterpiece and well-directed movie. Nearly perfect story line, without any doubt. Every cast played their roles naturally, especially Aamir Khan. I have watched an array of his previous movies but Dangal demonstrates his masterclass. In addition, credit should be given to all of the casts for the eminent acting. Granted, there are no typical love scenes, no unnecessary scenes and no visible technical non-senses. The time line was crystal clear. At 160 minutes, this film is fairly long. However, the background music and soundtracks were absolute stellar to uplift the ambiance of this movie. Overall, this flick is such an inspirational and elevating especially to drive our motivation to clinch the success. Highly recommended.","If you think Dangal is another textbook biography flick, I reckon you will be surprised with the entire flick from head to the toe.

81,Sublime efforts has earned a place in the hearts of movie goers. Excellent movie. The initial scenes have set the movie well – No time consuming introductions – and the narration gets intense when Mahavir starts training his daughters to be a wrestler. Funny dialogues and comedy sequences with Geeta's cousin were entertaining in the first half. The Haanikaarak Bapu song was so cute with the two daughters struggling to keep up with their father's training. Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar who played the role of young Geeta and Bhabita have showcased exceptional acting.,Sublime efforts has earned a place in the hearts of movie goers. Excellent movie.

How it would have felt to fight against the stereotype and launch Geeta and Babita into the wrestling arena that too in Haryana. The journey of a dream, the journey of an aspiration journey of a father and journey of two brave girls from the small village of Haryana to become the IKON of Indian National women wrestling. If you are movie goer like me, it is high time that you go line up in a theater near you and watch #DANGAL. Now a day amidst nudity, cheapness and useless love stories very rare to see people clap for a movie, that too in the US it is never easy to get the audience to clap. You will be thrilled to take the journey with Amir as a father. you will be on the edge of your seat for many scenes. you will come out of the theater inspired. Amir thanks for #Dangal, irrespective of insensitive remarks against India I opt to pay for your movie and really thankful that I did watch your tribute to Geeta, Babita, and Mahavir Singh Phogat.","What it would have felt to light up the fire for the first time ... what it would have felt to each individual who chose to break the stereotype.

85,"Though story is based on real life story, the movie fails to impress! I had a lot of expectations from the movie but was disappointed after watching it. The story is supposed to be about women wrestlers fighting against patriarchal society to win a gold medal. But in the movie, there is little to show that those girls were discriminated because they were girls! The movie would still be same if the protagonist were boys instead of girls (apart from a couple of dialogues)! There seems no struggle for phogat girls because they were girls! Many talk about this movie telling its patriotic! I fail to see there point! Patriotism is just a masala in the movie. Basically, Mahavir phogat wanted to win gold but failed, so he prepares his daughters for the win. Thats it! It's the dream of any sports person to win gold for the country and that is what is shown here! Thats it! Nothing different! Good thing about the movie is you won't get bored. There is a lot humour throughout the movie which keeps you entertained. Overall its just a one time watch.","Though story is based on real life story, the movie fails to impress!

The 160 min long film relies much on a strong screenplay that transition slowly into the perception of society towards the women, to the determination of Aamir khan to mold them into a world class wrestler and then struggle with the system to eventually end up with the rather predictable ending. The movie main hero is screenplay which keeps binding you with funny nuances, and yet emotional drama and relationship of father and daughter, and people around them.

This incomplete arc leaves a bitter taste on his soul, that just wouldn't go with the eflux of time. It just assumes another form; yearning. The yearning accrues into something bigger, a dream. A dream for a progeny- a son to complete his aspiration, carry his legacy forward. This dream keeps accruing in desperation through the birth of every daughter, till it comes to an eventual halt of acceptance at the birth of the fourth. He genuflects before destiny's hand in fashioning a future in a direction converse to his dream. A few years later, providence springs a surprise at him, in the form of his daughters. As it turns out, they're wrestlers too like their big man. This is enough for him to dust off his locked dream. And he goes after it like a marooned man at a wild boar. Redemption was all that he wanted- the elusive Olympic gold -and begetting a son was the means and not the end to it.

Many incidents portrayed are not true if the context of biography should be taken into account. Ex- the climax where Aamir's character is cunningly locked in a room by Coach Sodhi, which actually never happened. This movie is not only a great entertainer but also showcases how sports and athletics is suffering in India due to backward attitude. It also shows a great deal about women empowerment.

109,"The movie is adapted from a real story, perhaps placed in our reality, such a straight male cancer father will be vomited: You can't accomplish your dreams, why do you impose on your daughter? But that was in India. In that country, women were destined to marry people when they were 14 years old, and they could only keep giving birth to children and do housework. The father who appeared to be a tyrant imposed his dream on his daughter. In fact, it also forcibly changed their life path destined by this society.
Father's trembling hand sent us to the big world that he had never experienced, and he fully expected everyone to understand us and care for us like himself. How he wanted to put us under his own wings forever, until, until we could reach an impeccable state. But his father was only his father. He had no more abilities. He could only watch his children stumble toward this world full of temptations and traps.
We left the small town at home and came to the so-called big city. We saw more, learned more, and the world of flowers shook us so that we could not open our eyes. The appearance of the so-called friend brings everything you have never seen before, just strange. Gradually, you will lose yourself, thinking that you feel the wind of the world and touch the tip of the world. You disdain everything your father told you, you forgot the rule of being sure when you were young, and you said to your father, ""Your old set is out of date, and no one does that now."" Just like Gita told his father, it is not popular now. Wrestled like this!
We are growing up, and old and new conflicts will eventually occur. Some people say that parental love refers to parting love. They send their children to grow up, and children send them to grow old. For decades in a lifetime, there is only a period of intersection. What should I do when the children are rushing out, and their parents are afraid that they will fall and they will fold their wings? Only anxiety remained.
Gita and his father had a PK on the wrestling field when they were young, which gave me the climax of the whole movie. I clenched my fists tightly, and my tears couldn't stop flowing. I knew that the father needed to lose because of the plot-because the parents never really won their children.
In a wrestling, Gita used the ""pop"" skills taught by the coach to fight against his father's ""old-fashioned"" experience and eventually overwhelmed his father to the ground. What I saw was a battle between a young cheetah-like wrestler and an old wrestler from Maifa, and it was also a conflict between her daughter and her father. Not surprisingly, a young wrestler will win, and her daughter will also win. She flicked her hair and told her father, ""Look, your suit is outdated."" From childhood to the age, he has been trained by the father's devil, and the girl who loves beauty is forcibly cut off her beautiful long hair ... At this moment, she has spent her childhood. Shadow, defeated the mountain-like giant who oppressed herself, she should have a big sigh in her heart. His father was lying in the sand, gray-faced, like an old, bearded black bear. There was no remorse on his face, no anger and anger, just a little bit, so sad and helpless.","The movie is adapted from a real story, perhaps placed in our reality, such a straight male cancer father will be vomited: You can't accomplish your dreams, why do you impose on your daughter? But that was in India. In that country, women were destined to marry people when they were 14 years old, and they could only keep giving birth to children and do housework. The father who appeared to be a tyrant imposed his dream on his daughter. In fact, it also forcibly changed their life path destined by this society. Father's trembling hand sent us to the big world that he had never experienced, and he fully expected everyone to understand us and care for us like himself. How he wanted to put us under his own wings forever, until, until we could reach an impeccable state. But his father was only his father. He had no more abilities. He could only watch his children stumble toward this world full of temptations and traps. We left the small town at home and came to the so-called big city. We saw more, learned more, and the world of flowers shook us so that we could not open our eyes. The appearance of the so-called friend brings everything you have never seen before, just strange. Gradually, you will lose yourself, thinking that you feel the wind of the world and touch the tip of the world. You disdain everything your father told you, you forgot the rule of being sure when you were young, and you said to your father, ""Your old set is out of date, and no one does that now.""

118,"In portraying the image of oppressed women, this film took a different approach and selected two female wrestlers. For Gita and Babita, this is their only way out, but for more Indian women, their lives have been arranged early. It is also in such a social environment that the gold medal won by Gita at the end of the movie is so precious and so bloody. What impressed me most was that the father was locked in the dark room, I prayed silently not to let him out. I don't want to see actress regains the courage to defeat her opponent because of her father's arrival. Such an ending would make the film mediocre. Good thing is that the director didn't let me down. Her ability came from her father, but in the end she learned to fly alone.","In portraying the image of oppressed women, this film took a different approach and selected two female wrestlers.

Visionary veteran Mahavir Singh Phogat, against all odds of society, religiously manufacture his raw and uncooked daughters with utmost care prior to their introduction into the World of Wrestling which has been deliciously portrayed (literally yummy) by the ingenue Phogat siblings. While the energetic songs blend in seamlessly with a masterly written screenplay, the elder Phogat siblings raise the bar to the horizon performing through bout to bout. The choreography of bouts feel incredibly authentic on mat which is yet another genuine flavor in the biopic & as a vivid sports follower I must say that the dramatized scorelines will maintain the tempo upwards inside the theater. The entire cast & crew and the witty dialogues are again the contributing factor in this successful biopic besides the unnecessary pre-climax stunt and yes, Aamir- take a bow!!!

142,"Dangal Review:- I believe that movies with longer shelf life's are getting lesser day by day..there are very few movies which qualifies into that category that urges you to stop and watch them whenever you found them while changing any movie channelsI am pleased to announce one more entrant into category which is the latest AK blockbuster  Dangal. AK has been 5th time lucky with his December release Last time when you have seen AK at the village backdrop you were cheering him for the nail biting cricket match and I am sure this time you would do that for his daughter thrilling wrestling techniques, as he moved into much mature real time character Mahavir Singh Phogat. Not in a single frame you found him glamorous but still he manages to steal the show just by his sheer flawless performance n into the character approach. Mind you this movie is far beyond any comparison with Sallu Bhai Sultan, except for Harynavi & Bajaj Scooter. This one apart from giving you many insight about wrestling as a game (points 1, 3 &5 was explained very well) also deals very beautifully about the father-daughter relationship along with social hurdles for a women wrestlers. All in you could found a different AK with various shades of father, coach, mentor, wrestler etc. and the dialogue delivery from him that too in Haryanvi style was just a killerwith various inspirational and true to life messages. The movie is lengthy but with amazing screenplay, balanced 1st and 2nd halves, great supporting cast it makes the overall experience joyful n memorable right from beginning till end. Moreover even though the songs are not chart busters but it was superbly placed and it gels properly with the flow of the story and you would never found people moving out of the halls for some refreshments even when the songs are being screened. Daler Mehndi voiced title track which keeps coming in between pumps you with excitement n energy. Very well written and well sung. The second half was a clash between father ideology and daughter's approach which was so well portrayed and the father vs daughter wrestling and the climax was just mind-blowing. The new director had done full justice to the script and characters, from the opening scene of the movie one could very well judge his caliber and could hope that he keeps up the good work in his next venture otherwise he would be also gone missing like director of Sarforash. The pre- climax discussion between AK and his daughter will reminds you of Chak De 70 mint. But this time it was more emotional and realistic in Haryanvi style. Dangal's Mahavir Singh gives you many take awaythat a person with strong conviction could change anythingjust look at his confidence and belief during talking with butcher at meat shopI can only be a father or a coach at one point of time""Dangal ladnay se pehalay daar se ladana pedtha hai""etc there are many more and shouldn't be missed. All the sport biopic Chak DeBhaag Milkha BhaagMS Dhoni and this one too sends out a very strong message that ""Success is sweet but its secret is sweat""!! Do watch this Dhakad movie and I promise that you will come out from the hall with happiness all around.","Dangal Review:- I believe that movies with longer shelf life's are getting lesser day by day..there are very few movies which qualifies into that category that urges you to stop and watch them whenever you found them while changing any movie channelsI am pleased to announce one more entrant into category which is the latest AK blockbuster  Dangal.

All in you could found a different AK with various shades of father, coach, mentor, wrestler etc. and the dialogue delivery from him that too in Haryanvi style was just a killerwith various inspirational and true to life messages. The movie is lengthy but with amazing screenplay, balanced 1st and 2nd halves, great supporting cast it makes the overall experience joyful n memorable right from beginning till end. Moreover even though the songs are not chart busters but it was superbly placed and it gels properly with the flow of the story and you would never found people moving out of the halls for some refreshments even when the songs are being screened. Daler Mehndi voiced title track which keeps coming in between pumps you with excitement n energy. Very well written and well sung. The second half was a clash between father ideology and daughter's approach which was so well portrayed and the father vs daughter wrestling and the climax was just mind-blowing. The new director had done full justice to the script and characters, from the opening scene of the movie one could very well judge his caliber and could hope that he keeps up the good work in his next venture otherwise he would be also gone missing like director of Sarforash. The pre- climax discussion between AK and his daughter will reminds you of Chak De 70 mint. But this time it was more emotional and realistic in Haryanvi style. Dangal's Mahavir Singh gives you many take awaythat a person with strong conviction could change anythingjust look at his confidence and belief during talking with butcher at meat shopI can only be a father or a coach at one point of time""Dangal ladnay se pehalay daar se ladana pedtha hai""etc there are many more and shouldn't be missed. All the sport biopic Chak DeBhaag Milkha BhaagMS Dhoni and this one too sends out a very strong message that ""Success is sweet but its secret is sweat""!! Do watch this Dhakad movie and I promise that you will come out from the hall with happiness all around."

154,"Not only does Dangal methodically check off every sports movie cliché out there, it goes a step further into general movie clichés. Initially, I almost forgave some of them because it is, after all, ""based on a true story"", but as it turns out, it changed a lot of facts to fit those clichés. Artistic liberty makes sense when used to increase dramatic tension, but to make the story worse?

155,"Aamir Khan is known for being involved in films with a clear social message. After the insightful Taare Zameen Par (2007) and 3 Idiots (2009) declared that society is ruining children by pitting them against each other in mindless competition, Dangal (2016) does a 180 degree flip and celebrates ruining children by pitting them against each other in mindless competition. The father deals with his own personal insecurities by living vicariously through his daughters, denying them any of their own development or agency and reducing them to actors in his own personal fantasy that is under his control. In doing so, he shreds whatever is left of their education, social standing and health and dismisses these side effects as not ""real"" problems. His ambitions go far beyond instilling a normal type of achievement and goal-setting in his children. In any sane world, his parenting style would be recognised as toxic and he would be the villain of his story. Yet he's supposedly doing them a favour because the only other life alternative for women was forced marriage and domestic work. You heard it right, he liberated his daughters from having their fate imposed on them... by having their fate imposed on them.

No doubt there were a lot of good movies made in 2016, but this movie was a perfect closure for the year 2016.","All i can say here, when in doubt watch a Aamir Khan movie because you know you cant go wrong.

159,"#DANGAL review (No spoilers) The best thing about DANGAL is that there is no Aamir Khan- the superstar in the entire movie. There is just Mahavir Singh Phogat and his family. Their day to day struggles and their small triumphs ultimately leading to gold. It's a story of wrestling, of family, of emotions and basically everything which a person pursuing sports other than cricket experiences in India. It is also a deeply inspiring story of feminism. Geeta does what Aarfa Khan in Sultan couldn't. Aamir does what Salman couldn't- bring a character to life without the use of VFX. His character has many layers throughout the film. Was it his best performance till date? Well, we say that every alternate December. But like Virat Kohli, Aamir keeps scaling new heights in his every new innings..

We see the blood, sweat and tears that go into the making of champions. The actors who play the young Geeta and Babita do a competent job of turning into eager combatants from young-girls-who-just-want-to-have- fun.

Almost entire starcast is unheard of. Yet everyone have given such an amazing performance! Again, it maybe easier to find another actor who can dance and sing around. But not easy to find someone who can wrestle like an International athlete. I maybe biased for Aamir's best work being Taare Zameen Par, but this certainly comes close. The transformation of a National level wrestler to an aging old father, past his prime, the Haryanvi accent, the gait, everything about Mr Khan is just perfect. Besides, when was the last time you could take your entire family to a movie you were cringing at certain scenes, maybe some scenes were too violent, or raunchy - this is a movie you could and should take all your children (esp girl children) to watch.

The stars of the movie remain the two little girls that portray Geeta and Babita. The first half is a master piece.

174,This is the problem with Hindi movies. Hype to the peak and then when you actually see the movie it's just another ordinary movie. Happens with the movies with these Khans who have very limited acting capability. Dangal is know special. Same theme which you have scene in 50 movies before. Okay direction and lots of exaggeration which you can feel right there. After 1 week the films rating will drop like anything once the fans finish watching it. Dangal's cast is good and you could just watch once it's available for streaming. Going to theaters for this kind of movie is just a waste. 2nd half is slow and boring Coach character not shown right Unnecessary patriotic sentiment Seen several films like this before,This is the problem with Hindi movies.

Sadly, there does exist some blind fans who blatantly makes other actors such as Salman Khan movies hit even if those don't have good story in it.

We saw their names in the news, raised our eyebrows, and refocused back on our game of cricket.

186,"Aamir Khan (yes that idiot) is back with a bang and now this time around he 'dangals' with our minds! After watching this movie i felt that Dangal is that infectious cologne once sprayed its misty scent stays with you for a long long time. It is one of the rarest & finest Hindi movie in its genre, a much needed biopic on sports drama in the era of trash movies and junkie talkies. For the concept of women empowerment alone Dangal needs to be watched and cherished. Kudos to the entire cast for making this movie with so much grace, love, ambition, passion and devotion. Every single actor or individual associated with the movie seems to have dedicated themselves completely produce such effective cinema. And what can i say about the maestro himself? Aamir Khan at his best. Watch him in a scene when he engages in an argument/fight with Geeta or that phone conversation or the way he trains and coaches his daughters as it feels like you are watching the real Mahavir Singh himself who has so much passion for wrestling....absolutely brilliant! After watching him in Dangal I am convinced that NO OTHER ACTOR HAS GONE ABOVE & BEYOND LIKE AAMIR KHAN when you look at the types of movies, shows and roles he has played which are all very dynamic - be it sarfarosh, lagaan, rang de, TZP, 3 idiots, PK or DANGAL or even satyamev jayate...Aamir Khan knows cinema's reach & its powerful impact so why not use it wisely to produce/make movies which the audience can easily connect to known subjects/issues and then they righteously decide the impact for themselves - epic! Regarding the story, see it to believe it. There are few stumbling scenes in the 2nd half but its forgettable when you look at the big picture. One thing I would like to say though is take few napkins because you will need it!","Aamir Khan (yes that idiot) is back with a bang and now this time around he 'dangals' with our minds!

Meh. It is a no-risk same old story with just an average to good performance by Aamir. Nothing great. Anybody could have played Mahavir Singh Phogat. Eating cakes and going to gym isn't great acting.

194,"Born and raised in the small village Balali,in the state of Haryana, promising young athlete Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) made a mark on the national level for himself through wrestling,However his ultimate goal of becoming the first Indian wrestler to win a gold medal for India in the prestigious Commonwealth Games never fulfilled due to lack of physical & financial support. Mahavir finally succumbed to family pressure to find a real job and get married. He hoped for a son whom he could coach to become a wrestler who could represent India in the Commonwealth Games to win him the medal he dreamed of winning for himself.However things didn't panned out well as all his four children were born girls,it appeared that his dream has finally come to a standstill. The real story begins to twist when Mahavir's adolescent daughters Geeta (Zaira Wasim) and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar) get into a brawl with some rude neighbor boys and beat them up. Suddenly Mahavir realized that all he wanted is a successor of him who could win the medal in his place irrespective of the gender. He starts training his daughters to wrestle, building them their own training ring in a nearby field and intentionally pitting them against boys because,he believes, the only way athletes learn is by competing up with stronger & meaner opponents.If his daughters Geeta & Babita (played as young adults by Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra respectively) have the heart and skills, then there is no force that could stop them from winning & ultimately fulfilling his long held ambition & make him proud.The story then Plots on their journey to stardom. They put on the extra miles that serves to prove that will power,determination & self believe ultimately transforms into immense strength and endurance which enables one to do the impossible. This is what follows when finally one of Mahavir's daughters Geeta against all odds reached a mid-line between triumph and defeat when she reached the finals of the Commonwealth Games 2010 & Australian Wrestler Emily Bensted stood on her way to glory. Despite a nervous beginning she managed to recover from it & then lashed onto the opportunity & managed to win the Gold Medal that has eluded the Indian wrestlers on a global scale. Mahavir now a proud father was simply overjoyed & finally his daughter made him & others realize that being a girl or boy doesn't matter unless you have the strength to face reality & it's consequences. Truly a inspirational story for everyone to watch & specially to those women who are still fighting for a place that they are deprived off by others.This will act as a emotional boost for them & give them the strength they had been seeking for a long time.","Born and raised in the small village Balali,in the state of Haryana, promising young athlete Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) made a mark on the national level for himself through wrestling,However his ultimate goal of becoming the first Indian wrestler to win a gold medal for India in the prestigious Commonwealth Games never fulfilled due to lack of physical & financial support.

Also, avoid doing guest roles for the sake of friends, family & acquaintances like you have done in DhobhiGhat, Delhi Belly & Secret Superstar. DANGAL is incredibly impactful and a positive approach towards women empowerment. Fatima & Sanya have given impressive performances. The young Geeta & Babita aka Zaira & Suhani have also acted like mature artists. Dangal is must watch movie, which deserves your time. The best thing about the film is the wrestling fights. They are spontaneous and you feel like you are actually watching them live. The realism in characters, energy in wrestling and honesty in acting makes this movie a brilliant sporting journey.

201,"One of the strongest messages that he passes to the world, especially the villages of India is to believe that a woman's place is not just in the kitchen. Mahavira also believes that instead of raising our daughters with the objective to let them get married, we must ask them their dreams and help them achieve the same. This is where the duty of a true parent lies.","One of the strongest messages that he passes to the world, especially the villages of India is to believe that a woman's place is not just in the kitchen.

202,"When I saw the trailer for Dangal, I thought it was going to be above average at best. Then the movie was released and I heard positive reviews all around. On Christmas day, I went with my family and saw the movie. It was stellar, look I can talk about how Amir Khan's acting is brilliant but everything Amir Khan does is brilliant. I have seen this movie twice, the first time around I was blown away by the acting and story. The second time I saw the movie, I tried to pick it apart. I was ready to be bored the second time around, but I simply was not. The second time I appreciated the cinematography, and how things played out. The screenplay was beautifully written. Even though the movie is over two hours, it does seem like it. It flows pretty consistently. There is just enough drama throughout the movie to keep it interesting, but not to much to overwhelm it. Also I would like to add that this is not a typical Bollywood flick. I really like where the film industry is going. The action scenes were so alluring to look at. They were not big jump cuts in between each action scene. I don't have to say anything about the actors who played Geetha and Babita, they were amazing in their respectable roles. Overall, if you want to get inspired or want to watch an amazing bio-pick, I would highly recommend you watch it. I really hope that this at least gets nominated for Oscars.","When I saw the trailer for Dangal, I thought it was going to be above average at best.

203,"One of the best Hindi movies ever.Aamir's acting was on the spot. Direction wise,Nitesh Tiwari has done an excellent job.The actors who played the role of Geeta and Babita were so apt to that role. Songs are in sync with the situations in the movie and they sound good. The role played by Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat was one of his best performances ever. Overall,it was an excellent all-round performance from story- telling,cinematography,acting,direction,screenplay and music.It is definitely worth to wait Aamir's movie every time. Even though he makes very few movies but he makes sure that he delivers best performances every time and addresses the flaws in the Indian society in a meaningful way.The best Christmas gift for everyone from Dangal Team.","One of the best Hindi movies ever.Aamir's acting was on the spot.

204,"Just came home after watching the movie. It really is a masterpiece! A compelling narrative based on a true story. Add stellar acting performances and humor. Pour in cinematography, location, songs & meaningful lyrics. Voila! Everything amazingly fits together in a single string. Truly clean entertainment. In all sense of the word. Worth watching with family. A good movie should entertain. A great movie must connect. And connect, it did. I could almost feel as if I were there, throughout. The plot development is deep, and engaging. Outstanding performance by all. And Aamir Khan! Boy, he never disappoints! 10/10","Just came home after watching the movie. It really is a masterpiece!

205,"Okay, so, I'm an American who has no ties to the Indian Film Industry nor to Bollywood but I love to watch their movies. I've religiously watched Bollywood for the past 3 years and I have not seen a movie so balanced with family and sport and female empowerment than this one. Maybe 'Mary Kom' but even that didn't give me the chills that 'Dangal' produced. 
Geeta and Babita stole my heart, especially when they were younger and just embarking on their journey as wrestlers. The most poignant scene, for me, comes when they were still in their youth, learning a lesson of gratitude that they were blind to before. 
Indian films, in general, make you more aware of how important family is and after watching this it made me think of things differently that my mom had done to me when I was younger, all in the desire to make me a stronger woman. I love this movie so much for that message, the message that a woman can be just as strong, if not stronger, than any man or foe she is against. 
I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so just go watch the movie and realize for yourself how amazing it truly is.","Okay, so, I'm an American who has no ties to the Indian Film Industry nor to Bollywood but I love to watch their movies.

206,"Mahavir Singh Phogat is an unbelievably inspiring father, who fought against stereotypes and society, for himself, his girls and the pride of our Nation. It has shown, how once again the bureaucracy of the nation is eating away real chances of the talented athletes. The film is well acted, well scripted and a joy to experience. The success of this film is welcome and is a testament that the Indian audience doesn't just crave for the senseless no-brainier stories.","Mahavir Singh Phogat is an unbelievably inspiring father, who fought against stereotypes and society, for himself, his girls and the pride of our Nation.

207,"Liked the third person narrative, It was funny and interesting. Child geeta was excellent. Btw all the casting was perfect. Grown up geeta's aggression was real. Proper wrestling played by kids as well as grown ups. Aamir khan was the perfect father, liked his acting from start to end. Only negative is the end scenes where the rival from Australia who was overconfident and was looking fake. The coach from national institute did a great job, on the negative role but his acting was great. Girls cousin role was very funny and he was never angry when he was ragged and used for the girls.","Liked the third person narrative, It was funny and interesting. Child geeta was excellent.

Once you begin to watch the movie, you do not wish to go for the interval because the director gets you so engrossed.

However, after watching the trailer and songs on TV I went ahead and booked the tickets to watch on the 2nd day of release. I am so glad I watched this movie. A complete entertainer and absolutely wonderful acting by all the main characters. I have a new found respect for all the athletes out there who work really hard to achieve their dreams/ goals.

The film tries hard to make his character look good. In the scene where Geeta and Babita goes to a friend's marriage and she explains them how their father does right by forcing them to wrestle is completely nonsense. It's a really illogical scene.","On surface this film looks really good, but if you go deep you will find many flaws in the script and the story looks too fake.

The editing was so lacking that I wanted to fast forward to what I wanted to get at rather than relish the pace. Indian cinema needs a visionary filmmaker and stories. Chak De was 10 times better and can be enjoyed even to this day. Not that Aamir didn't work hard for it but the package just didn't come in as well as it could have been. Compromises must have been made to alter the story in favor of mass consumption but then that is what will happen when you bring in a big star.

However the core motivation in this movie is still disgusting, it's simply a well display of ""what is patriarchy"".

237,"Never seen the audience rising during any movie for the anthem... A truly inspiring film by Aamir Khan. Both actors playing Geeta and Babita were exceptional, so were the younger ones. Dangal is a film where Mahavir Phogawat, a national champion, who gives up on his dream to win gold medal for India because of his poverty. He wants his son to be a wrestler, but his every time he becomes the father, its a girl. There's one incident where he realizes that his girls can make his dream come true and starts their training to make them wrestlers. Brilliant work by Nitesh Tiwari, Pritam, Amitabh Bhattacharya and the cast. The movie also throws light on the typical small town mentality people of how they see a girl and the unwelcoming of females in sports like wrestling. An outstanding performance by Aamir Khan- A true perfectionist who transformed his body the way he wanted to be pictured. When you put your blood and sweat in the training, the hard work and discipline pays off for you to become a winner!","Never seen the audience rising during any movie for the anthem... A truly inspiring film by Aamir Khan. Both actors playing Geeta and Babita were exceptional, so were the younger ones. Dangal is a film where Mahavir Phogawat, a national champion, who gives up on his dream to win gold medal for India because of his poverty. He wants his son to be a wrestler, but his every time he becomes the father, its a girl. There's one incident where he realizes that his girls can make his dream come true and starts their training to make them wrestlers. Brilliant work by Nitesh Tiwari, Pritam, Amitabh Bhattacharya and the cast. The movie also throws light on the typical small town mentality people of how they see a girl and the unwelcoming of females in sports like wrestling. An outstanding performance by Aamir Khan- A true perfectionist who transformed his body the way he wanted to be pictured. When you put your blood and sweat in the training, the hard work and discipline pays off for you to become a winner!"

Its cinematography is best from those Indian film I have seen. It's ahead to compete with ""Lagan"" and ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"". Aamir Khan is always hardworking and try to get perfection. Here child actress are excellent in performance. South Asian family emotion was not absent in movie. Game was too much thrilling... This is also best Biography movie in recent years like: ""Genius"", ""Machine Gun Preacher"".

1. All the drama with coach was fictional.
2. It was not her first gold, she won a gold year before in Commonwealth wrestling championship.
3. The drama with Australian opponent was fictional.
4. The drama with locked mahavir was fictional.
5. Final match was fictional, actual match ended in two rounds without the opponent scoring a single point.
6. The drama with short hair was fictional, real life Geeta had long hairs during her final match.","This is my first review.

Every actor and actress have played their part beautifully,great acting by Amir and arguably his best performance till date. The story is so beautifully told that I didn't want it to be over. The actresses just blew me away,they were just awesome. Best biographical movie ever made in Bollywood. I definitely think Dangal should be the official entry to Oscar from India. if anyone has not seen it yet please go for this movie.It is worth every bit of your time and money. Just the kind of movie i was waiting for.","I don't think i have ever a watched a movie so intensely involving as this one,every bit of this movie is moving and touching.

The starting scene of the Movie is just added to show Aamir body and it was unnecessary, it gives you initial setback to your Movie expectation. The first half of Dangal is OK and as expected, Young girls did fabulous job. The film's second half is pathetic with all lacklustre drama. Movie loses its focus in second half from Geeta turned her attention to fame, which leads tension between her father and her. I was a big fan of Aamir Khan earlier but first his PK and now Dangal proved he is not the same actor as we used to know him earlier. However PK story line, Acting was pathetic but this Movie has a great story line, excellent trailer to build up the atmosphere but when i watched Director looked clueless. Now a days everybody is busy making good trailer to fool audience, by the time people realize the movie is good or bad movie already declare hit. Reviewers are paid to give 4- 5 Star rating.","I saw this Movie ""Dangal"" Yesterday and feel disappointed the way it turned out.

Main lead role is Aamir Khan who is a father of girls. He used to a wrestler but never won gold medal at international level. He wants to have a boy who can win gold medal, and fulfill his dream. Unfortunately he has four daughters. One moment in movie realized him that gold medal is gold medal whether a boy gets it or girl.Movie covered in two parts.

This movie might be good for Indian people and I think this high rating on IMDb is mainly coming from Indians, but as an international person, this movie was not good at all. The script/dialogues were awful and some part of the movie (like many other Indian movies) was childish. For example, the national coach and Geet's father competition was very weird and not true. The movie was very predictable and it was obvious from the beginning of the movie that what was going to happen during the movie. The only thing that was great was the camera. It was very good.

As with most of this Khan's crowd pleasers, it's acutely attuned to wider realities: beyond the mat, the Singhs encounter superstition, child brides and institutional slackness, each sidebar reflecting a social struggle.

273,"Dangal- Movie Review A movie about two wrestling champions and their family. I remember the famous saying ""when the going gets tough, the tough get going"". Their lives prove it all. How can I leave their father? Such a commendable role he has played in their lives. Wait wait.... I'm supposed to talk about the the movie and not Geetha and Babitha's life. ""Well, it's not my mistake"". It's the director's mistake to have a wonderful team and also make us forget that we are in a movie. Aamir khan's dedication and passion towards movies is seen in the film. How can I forget the two champs who have put their heart and soul in this. ""Great going girls"". Background score, and music, though I do not know Hindi, the subtitles itself made the music seem sensible and going side by side with the movie. I loved the theme music of this movie. There was no lag in the movie. Sometimes we find our teachers/gurus being so tough (though this can never be compared with Mahaveer Singh), but what is wrong in that? That's how we nurture Dangal- the girls victory","Dangal- Movie Review A movie about two wrestling champions and their family.

If you watched '3 idiots' also featuring Aamir Khan, you will probably expect this movie to be on the same level. And let me tell you, you will not be disappointed. What left a footprint in my mind is that they made the deciding moment so epic because it felt like those moments in Hollywood movies where a certain detail from a previous scene suddenly rises to the rescue. I could not think that kind of moment would appear in a movie like this. And girl power is so beautifully and naturally depicted that all the so-called women empowerment themed Hollywood movies would have to take off their hats. 100% recommended!","I rarely give a movie a 10 , unless it truly touches elemental feelings inside my heart.

279,"We chose Dangal, a biopic about Mahavir Singh Phogat and his daughters, Geeta and Babita. Mahavir (Aamir Khan) is a former wrestler who had to forego his sport to support his family. Even though he is living out his dreams through his children he also gives them a future full of choices. Training also allows them to form a close relationship, which is uncommon in their culture. It is interesting to see the girls learn to appreciate their father as they grow from young girls (Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar) to young women (Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra). As Geeta and Babita begin to embrace their training, they become more confident and competitive. Mahavir endures the taunts of his village and wrestling peers while having continued confidence and pride in his daughters. The matches are exciting and visceral, I felt myself holding my breath. When Geeta begins training with Coach Kadam (Girish Kulkarni) she seems to lose her edge, which returns when she reconnects with her father. The relationship between the father/coach and the National coach demonstrates how small and petty men can be. The original music gives depth to the storyline.","We chose Dangal, a biopic about Mahavir Singh Phogat and his daughters, Geeta and Babita.

282,I must admit I have a number of Aamir films in my favourite list and Dangal is right there in the top 3. Outstanding work from the entire team. Makes you want to meet them and tell them how good the film actually is (wish I could). Incredible dedication from the word go to the end credits. You've got to admit it no one comes close to Aamir in terms of sheer hard-work and performance so natural that his eyes say more than his words sometimes. Sakshi is mighty effective as the mother torn between her husband and children. The girls the real heroes of this incredible film are out of the world. Superior acting with true grit and determination that shows with utmost sincerity. The kid that plays the nephew and then Aparshakti adds to the surprisingly funny moments you'd normally not expect from a biopic. Special mention to the director Nitish Tiwari who has captained this ship like a seasoned campaigner possibly teaching a lesson or two to some of the more commercial directors. Music is rooted to the ground. The title track is hair raising. Demonetization be damned. Watch this film for its sheer brilliance. Kudos to the entire team and to the real Phogat family...Salute!!!,I must admit I have a number of Aamir films in my favourite list and Dangal is right there in the top 3.

Meh. It is a no-risk same old story with just an average to good performance by Aamir. Nothing great. Anybody could have played Mahavir Singh Phogat. Eating cakes and going to gym isn't great acting.

288,"This movie bearing semblance to the triplet (Alphabet D ""Dhoom 3"", Aamir Khan and Pritam) stands out in every frame invoking our lost cherishment of Hindi cinema. Films on Sports, women-centric themes or jingoism have drawn flak from a certain section of the society or the masses due to their biased / judgmental approach to the screenplay. Movies generally exercise many cinematic liberties and cliché that make or break the BO, based on the movie's credentials. In case of Dangal, we get to experience an awesome alignment of production values, screenplay (deftly crafted), music (Pritam pitches to perfection) and artiste's performance (debutantes pull your heart strings!!). As was widely published, the movie is about a relentless father (erstwhile wrestler) who breeds his daughters to be wrestling champions to bring glory to the motherland (mind you, there isn't a slightest overture about ""desh bhakti"" barring the national anthem played In then end). The very premise of the story leaves a gamut of human sentiments to be kindled as per bollywood's formulaic studious, yet, Dangal restrains and sticks to its core theme – ""sportsmanship is all about patience and perseverance, which are the biggest virtues of life too"". Director, less-known for churning blockbusters (no offense intended), this time has struck gold with his tactical treatment of the subject with no submission to any sort of emotional outbursts or commercial compromises. Be it the childhood clutches of the wrestling-sisters, the dramatic episodes in the Sports Academy, the untold emotions between baap- beti, the euphoric display of the wrestling ring, or the tears of triumph which trickle down (the eyes of the artistes and audience alike), every sequence is laced with indelible dialogues, unique expressions, underplayed stardom and subtle transition in the characters. To mince matters, as the film industry draws curtains to 2016, it's a sheer pleasure to watch the ""teen sisters"" hit ""sixes"" in this unparalleled portrayal of WOO(Window Of Opportunity)MEN POWER!!...","This movie bearing semblance to the triplet (Alphabet D ""Dhoom 3"", Aamir Khan and Pritam) stands out in every frame invoking our lost cherishment of Hindi cinema.

290,"Dangal is the most overrated film I have watched in a very long time. Every unbiased movie lover, I think, would agree to the fact that the cinematic representation is not any different from any sports related movie you pick, be it Gavin O'Connor's ""Miracle"" or Shimit Amin's ""Chak De India"". There goes your point for originality. Now if we take the ""Biographical"" thing into account then the film at most can be described as ""Inspired by real life events"". Winning at the last round at the last moment may be more adrenaline rushing for the audience but that, in my opinion, is demeaning for the athlete who originally won the game 1-0, 7-0. Talking of demeaning, the way sports persons have been depicted in the film is something to talk about. The fake things that are shown in the movie in the name of cinematic liberty just for the sake of creating sympathy in the audience, be it locking up Mr. Phogat in a room during finals or the Australian player's interview, both are very against Sportsman spirit. Aamir Khan's dedication is unquestionable, he also is a good actor. He took great efforts to look like a wrestler for so little screen time. All the talks of perfection and look at overweight actress who played the Australian wrestler. Does she even have an athlete's physique? An entire film can not be made with one dedicated actor. There are also contradictory statements about women's equality in the movie, which I am not going into much details as this is a ""biographical movie"". At least let's not hurt other's emotion just to make one person look like a hero when dealing with real people. In our country it's a very dangerous thing to affect people's emotion in a wrong way. I feel bad for the real NSA coach of Geeta Phogat.","Dangal is the most overrated film I have watched in a very long time.

In this movie, Pamir Khan plays the role of father, who has two daughters and no son, but he is different from other Indian men. He hopes to help his daughter get rid of the traditional women's life and realize their own life. The two daughters are gifted in wrestling, and their father helped them become world-class players with devil like training. There are many humorous passages in the film, but they contain deep father's love.","Under the Indian system, women are taught to be good wives and mothers when they are young and marry as women at a very young age, which makes it difficult to realize their life values and dreams.

It's good to hear that I want to download all the soundtrack and the pictures full of exotic customs and high saturation. It's not a heavy but tearful plot deliberately. It's funny, but it's also a profound connotation of thinking... A real movie!

After seeing his introduction of fattening and losing weight for the film, he has more admiration than admiration.

That was the biggest mistake of Amir Khan, i believe that for the real life Geeta Phogat the struggles must have been something that we cannot even imagine and how she won the gold becoming the first Indian woman ever to do so and her story as it happened without any changes whatsoever has to be told to the world because she deserves that respect, instead of the artificiality that was shown in the movie. It would have deserved the Oscar if they would have replicated the exact and perfectly copied fight from the original fight which was historic for Indian women wrestlers,just like they did in ""Miracle"" the movie about Ice Hockey. Or at least have a alternate version of the movie and re-release it before Oscars,so that Amir Khan can win the first Oscar too for India just like her Pahalwan did in real life.

349,"DANGAL, which means ""wrestling"" in Hindi, is the passion of Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan), a talented amateur wrestler who never won gold for his country but longs to train his sons to fulfill his dream. When his wife bears daughter after daughter, he adjusts his plan, forcing his preteen girls Geeta (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Sanya Malhotra) to train like professional athletes. He cuts their hair off and drags them to compete against boys, humiliating them. The town disapproves, but Phogat bends to no one, imposing 5 a.m. Trainings and workouts with a nephew to toughen the girls up. It's not until the girls skip training to attend a wedding that their eyes are opened to the fate of most Indian village girls. The miserable bride expresses her envy over their father's attention. She points out that girls are considered burdens until they're married off at 14, when a husband they've never met before takes charge of them, gets them pregnant, and relegates them to childcare and kitchen duty for the rest of their lives. Babita and Geeta train with enthusiasm from that point on, winning so many bouts that first Geeta and then Babita both earn spots on the coveted national women's team, which boards and trains them far from home and their father's wise and watchful eye. A vain and incompetent coach tries to erase their father's training, substituting an emphasis on technique that results in losses. As the girls learn to trust their father and appreciate his respect for them, they reject the coach, revel in their own passion for wrestling, and bring pride to themselves and their country.","DANGAL, which means ""wrestling"" in Hindi, is the passion of Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan), a talented amateur wrestler who never won gold for his country but longs to train his sons to fulfill his dream. When his wife bears daughter after daughter, he adjusts his plan, forcing his preteen girls Geeta (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Sanya Malhotra) to train like professional athletes. He cuts their hair off and drags them to compete against boys, humiliating them.

Like they initially don't want to be trained and then after realizing the good in it, they joined the campaign with full force. 70 minute moment before finals. Obviously, it was 6 minutes only. Rough competition in the semifinal. In short watching this movie makes me feel like I have watched a mixture of a 4-5 sports movie. Especially after the interval. Before the interval, the experience was quite funny. Overall it's a good watch, but doesn't deserve this rating.","I think the movie is slightly overrated.

420,"First of all, I just love the idea of love and it was pure love between the couple in the story. The chemistry between Avinash Tiwary and Mrunal Thakur was super cool. The nuances of the dialogues they had between characters, the looks, the idea of having a radio was just cherry on top of the cake. And the tragedy their relationship faced, moreover the inter-religious warfare that the two humans had to face. That look to the butcher in front of the house, and the sound of opening of that door lock, their reaction to it, and then showing the real world and the world left behind.","First of all, I just love the idea of love and it was pure love between the couple in the story.

447,"The film Dangal, starring Aamir Khan, is based on a true story in countryside India. The father was once a successful wrestler but was forced to give up his dream due to financial straits. He hopes that his sons could fulfill his dream but he only has four daughters. However, he discovers the striking talents of wrestling in his two daughters by accident. Then the father trains the daughters strictly and finally they become champions. The inspirational scenes of wrestling in the movie are so amazing that they arouse strong passion among audience. When watching the final scene in which Geeta defeats her opponent in the final round and the national anthem starts for her championship, I got moved because their father's dream is finally fulfilled after various frustrations and Geeta eventually becomes a successful woman with self value, which is contrasted with the traditional female images in India. She experienced a harsh childhood. Her strong ambition as well as masculine appearance always couldn't be understood by people with traditional Hindustani mind. She is also torn between the hardline approaches of her father and the theory-oriented approach by her coach and fell into confusion after she attends the sports academy. But at the time that she wins in the international competition and the national flag rises for her, we could see that fortunately, all her hard work pays off. The status of women in athletic field gains recognition. And that exciting moment also marked that the deep-rooted stereotype that women are destined to depend on their husbands could be alleviated in Indian people's mind. The film emphasizes nationalism and feminism. The patriarchal father definitely loves their daughters deeply, which could be revealed in the wedding scene. In countryside Indian society, women usually don't have any right to fulfill their own dreams, but Geeta's father firmly allows their daughters to challenge the tradition. He believes that his daughters are so excellent that they shouldn't be chosen by men in marriage. Furthermore, I want to say that the actors in the film are all extremely devoted. I hear from the news that Aamir Khan changes his posture rapidly during the shoot of the film in order to fit the appearance of the father in different periods. Also, the wrestling scenes performed by the daughters are amazing. They remind me of the fighting scenes in Deewar(1975) in which Vijay fights against the villains in a warehouse. Both of them succeed in shocking the audience and the win of the protagonist could push the plot into climax. Compared to earlier melodramatic Bollywood films, Dangal appears to be more authentic and convincing. This inspirational story of how women from Indian countryside win wrestling champion step by step could stimulate audience.","The film Dangal, starring Aamir Khan, is based on a true story in countryside India.
