0,"Now that the first season is over, I can confidently say that this series has exceeded my expectations. It uses witty scripts and detailed animation to bring the fans the service they've been wanting and more. Each episode is quite varied so there are many different scenarios and you never know how it will turn out or which characters will show up. The series wastes no time explaining any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and just gets to the point of the scenarios, and also starts to merge the scenarios without warning. This is for the fans, not casual viewers! However, the variety of episodes also means that the quality and tone also vary quite drastically. The short runtime means that many events and battles are cut short. There was a good amount of care to make everything canon and consistent, but there are still some shortcomings and the power/ability of each character seemed to be contrived based on the needs of the plot.","Now that the first season is over, I can confidently say that this series has exceeded my expectations.

1,This is fun. I am enjoying every story.,This is fun. I am enjoying every story.
2,"A brilliant concept and a great way to view some alternative plots within the storylines that every Marvel fan knows, but horribly inconsistent. Some can lack any real power, Captain Carter not being too captivating although an interesting plot, T'Challa as Star Lord being a little too perfect, but others, like the murder of the Avengers are engrossing. It's just so disappointing that an episode such as Dr Strange losing his heart, which is poetic, powerful and beautiful, can be followed by the most disappointing Zombies episode imaginable. Zombies, was a particular waste.","A brilliant concept and a great way to view some alternative plots within the storylines that every Marvel fan knows, but horribly inconsistent.

4,"Six episodes in, I have yet to be entertained by one. The concepts are awful. They're not interesting unless you're a die hard fan boy of Marvel comics. For the rest of us very casual fans, give us something. I've been bored on all six episodes I've seen so far and the seventh is what if Thor was an only child. So what?","Six episodes in, I have yet to be entertained by one. The concepts are awful. They're not interesting unless you're a die hard fan boy of Marvel comics.

5,"Now that I have seen all the episodes, I am still rating this 10 out of 10. I love the animation and different multiverse timeline stories. How it all came together in the end was brilliant. I will absolutely watch this numerous times. I really hope we get more seasons. Dr. Strange's episode was my favorite but I appreciate each episode for their brilliance, underlining meanings and symbolism.","Now that I have seen all the episodes, I am still rating this 10 out of 10.

6,The show begins with a monologue about how single choice change events but none of the major changes were spawned by the inciting incident instead random changes were made that didn't make any sense and ultimately changed the First Avenger story into something that a crappy fanfic writer that never saw the movie but was told by a friend about it would write.,The show begins with a monologue about how single choice change events but none of the major changes were spawned by the inciting incident instead random changes were made that didn't make any sense and ultimately changed the First Avenger story into something that a crappy fanfic writer that never saw the movie but was told by a friend about it would write.
7,"I barely use Disney plus but it's definitely worth it sometimes. What If...? Is magnificent for it's beautiful colors, brilliant possibilities and geeking out for the joys in life! I absolutely love the casts for the voices and everything related to Marvel universe is worth it. I can be completely satisfied for the Emmy's since I've seen a large bulk of the shows up for nominations. IMDb didn't use to require 600 characters that awkward for me since I generally don't make long reviews so stalling is fine I guess; a lot of great episodes to enjoy with the series. Perfect story with epic action to crave, the best aspect is how some of the same Marvel cast is involved in this!","I barely use Disney plus but it's definitely worth it sometimes. What If...?

9,IMDB really needs to work on their audience review system. All the bad reviews are only for 1 episode and not the entire series.

11,"A very straight forward episode of rushing things to set those pieces right into the puzzle. And my facial expressions were also pretty straight watching this episode as there was no thrill or even a logical storytelling, I understand it's an aminated show targetted at children maybe? But only those children who are familiar with all the MCU till now might perhaps be able to enjoy it.","A very straight forward episode of rushing things to set those pieces right into the puzzle.

12,"An animated series consisting of 9 nicely packed MCU ""parallel"" episodes, with two of them exceptional, episodes 4 and 8. That's a show for fans of the comics, easy on the eyes, fast-paced, some enthralling, some cringe-worthy, but overall satisfying.","An animated series consisting of 9 nicely packed MCU ""parallel"" episodes, with two of them exceptional, episodes 4 and 8.

You're telling me that the most stubborn maniac in the universe changes his mind just because star lord is now from wakanda. I think it's just lazy writing for the most part. I know there's people that will like this a lot because it's quirky marvel stuff, and I thought I was going to like it, but honestly it's very meh.","Honestly questionable writing.

20,"Okay, right off the bat this episode SEEMED like it was going to work with The Watcher's opening narration, but it dissolved into fan-fiction self-indulgence the millisecond Steve Roger's Iron-Man suit came into play; that and the AWFUL dialogue being filled with one-liners that'd be in place for an action-adventure film parody like Last Action Hero and condensing Captain America's plot into a half-hour episode that felt like a network mandate rather than creative choice.","Okay, right off the bat this episode SEEMED like it was going to work with The Watcher's opening narration, but it dissolved into fan-fiction self-indulgence the millisecond Steve Roger's Iron-Man suit came into play; that and the AWFUL dialogue being filled with one-liners that'd be in place for an action-adventure film parody like Last Action Hero and condensing Captain America's plot into a half-hour episode that felt like a network mandate rather than creative choice."

23,"I am still not sure if I like it or not. On the one hand I like the potential of the show. On the other hand many episodes didn't satisfy me. They want to do too much in a short amount of time. They give you like a quick origins story, then some quick action around the topic of the show and then it's finished. They also wanted to be too 'woke' for my taste. In the last episode the assembled cast of characters doesn't make any sense to me for the task they had to do.","I am still not sure if I like it or not.

26,"""What If"" (S01, 9 eps, 1/2hr, Dis+) has a really decent premise. However, the way it's implemented in this era of political corr-azy and ""I'm so woke"" makes it so predictable. It's like they go out of their way to build up women and non-Euro races as the What If heroes, but it's more pandering than interesting. And they're all so idealized, clean as bleach. It's antiseptic in the way we all hated the Star Wars prequels. As such it comes across more as After School special than gritty storytelling. Seriously, with the material at their disposal this could've been an awesome set of adventuring instead of the safe, PG fare it mostly bored us with. What if this series was made for adults by adults that pay the subscriptions for these services?! That's a What If premise the majority of us could get behind.","""What If"" (S01, 9 eps, 1/2hr, Dis+) has a really decent premise.

31,"When I originally heard about this show it didn't interest to me, to be honest. I liked the concept and all but since its existence won't have any impact on the current MCU timeline, I thought why even bother to make it?

32,"Had a hard time getting into these. The first episode went heavy-handed with the empowerment message of a much more unrealistically perfect, less faulted gender swapped character. The other episodes just didn't do much for me and just felt like mildly interesting variations. The art feels less organic and more like something pumped out of a computer by a committee. It was interesting to hear some of the original character voices but that's about it.","Had a hard time getting into these.

57,"A fresh and fun animated dive through the multiverse that is in turns wildly dark, irritatingly brief, surprisingly funny and mind-blowingly extreme. The stiff 3D animation is not flawless, but the swanky stylised cel-shading, pleasant palettes and beautiful background work helps buckets and by the end I barely noticed it. The biggest limitation to me is the runtime of the episodes, which can often make it feel overwhelmingly breathless and doesn't give some plots room to settle. With the snappier episodes (party Thor, Doctor Strange, the penultimate one) this can work in its favour, but with others (Peggy Carter, Yellowjacket, Zombies) it leaves them feeling like a ""previously on"" montage rather than a proper plot. All-in-all though the starry voice cast, the pleasing anthology vibe and the fun continuity games make this the strongest Disney+ offering yet. Here's hoping season 2 lets the episodes dictate how long they need to work, we're no longer in the syndicationverse after all!","A fresh and fun animated dive through the multiverse that is in turns wildly dark, irritatingly brief, surprisingly funny and mind-blowingly extreme.

72,"OK, four episodes in and, after reading some of the really SILLY negative reviews, I have to comment. I don't believe many of the negative nancies watched a second of this show. And really, IMDB has to do something about Robo-reviewers, because they really get ridiculous. Honestly, I read the comic when it came out and they were really bad stories. The best issue was #3 ""What if the Avengers Never Existed?"" This show, the best animated and voice acted (DC has been leaving Marvel in the DUST in this regard) since Fox X-Men, has been very entertaining. Obviously some 'reviewers' have totally missed that these all take place in ALTERNATE REALITIES. For those who wish a little history, DC started this idea (and really needs to make some Elseworlds, the modern variant animated movies or shows) with their 'Imaginary Stories', which is a way of looking at things from a different POV. I never realized there were so many misogynistic fans among the various fanbases-but man have they come out in droves. I really thought the 21st century was going to be better-but I am so disappointed. No one is saying that Captain America doesn't exist, but in an ALTERNATE REALITY, Captain Carter is that universes hero. Big deal? Carter was a bad-ass without the super soldier serum. So T'Challa got kidnapped by morons and became Star-Lord (I actually prefer the original Star Lord, the Peter Quill who was an astronaut and became Star Lord, but that's going waaaaay back). The Avengers never existed (My favorite episode so far, totally dominated by Sam Jackson and Tom), and now Dr. Strange who... nope. No Spoilers! I'll be editing this in the future. But so far, I'm enjoying this show-even if it is only dealing with the MCU and not the larger, comics universe.

129,"The show does have good potential, and the animation was great. It was interesting to see this different angle, however this first episode struggled from a short run time. The emotional beats did not hit because they were resolved too quickly, so there was no tension throughout. Additionally, the story just didn't appeal to me, the concept never peaked my interest as they didn't do anything particularly new with it.","The show does have good potential, and the animation was great.

133,"I like how the MCU is trying new things with it's shows. Arguably, this is the MCU's most experimental project yet. It does a great job exploring the multiverse, but the pacing is too fast, and the episodes need to be about 15-20 minutes longer to fully flesh out the stories. It does a good job twisting old stories from the MCU. The animation is good for the most part. Marvel does a great job taking advantage of the animation to make great action scenes. And they also did a good job with character movements. The voice acting was pretty good.

237,"First off, animation is incredible and the action is fantastic. The story concepts are put together very well and very interesting to see play out. The voice acting can be great at times, but struggles to fit in at others. This probably comes from using live action actors who probably aren't used to voice acting. This could easily get better over time. The story beats come quickly which makes sense, it's difficult to tell a movie in 30 minutes.

267,"Now that the first season is over, I can confidently say that this series has exceeded my expectations. It uses witty scripts and detailed animation to bring the fans the service they've been wanting and more. Each episode is quite varied so there are many different scenarios and you never know how it will turn out or which characters will show up. The series wastes no time explaining any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and just gets to the point of the scenarios, and also starts to merge the scenarios without warning. This is for the fans, not casual viewers! However, the variety of episodes also means that the quality and tone also vary quite drastically. The short runtime means that many events and battles are cut short. There was a good amount of care to make everything canon and consistent, but there are still some shortcomings and the power/ability of each character seemed to be contrived based on the needs of the plot.","Now that the first season is over, I can confidently say that this series has exceeded my expectations.

283,"This was a great show. In my opinion, this show is tied with Wandavision (2021) for second best Marvel Disney+ show. Loki (2021) is first, and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021) was last. This show was so unique. It was so cool seeing all the different realities of famous Marvel moments and how things would have played out if they happened in the Marvel universe we all know. I also thought the writing for the episodes were great. A few episodes like the Captain Carter one, and the Killmonger episode could have been a little better, but it was still pretty decent. I liked how each episode told a story in a different universe, then they all culminated in the final episode. There was also some really good animated action sequences in the show. The animators did a great job, I though the animation was great, especially during the action scenes. Lastly, just like any Marvel production, the acting was great. All of the Marvel actors who reprised their roles were obviously perfect, but it was the full time voice actors who stole the show. Some who stood out were Mark Wingert as Tony Stark, and Lake Bell as Black Widow. Ross Marquand who played Ultron in the final two episodes, and the Red Skull in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame was also great. His range of voices is so impressive. Those were just the three best in my opinion. There were many more. The only flaw of this show was them needing to cut the Tony and Gamora episode in Sakaar. It made a part of the finale confusing, but they will air it in season 2.","This was a great show. In my opinion, this show is tied with Wandavision (2021) for second best Marvel Disney+ show.

I always like these stories from the comics as they would play so differently from what we know from the story. And when reading comments about why they made these changes and what they did differently, it irritates me that I would always comment down, dude, read the comics and see how differently they did it. But the MCU had their versions of a what-if from the movies, and I thought it was a pretty good idea from that. My favorites were What if Ultron won and Doctor Strange lost his heart instead of his hands. These two were massive scale from these episodes, and I always like the endings where it's tragic from them and they couldn't have done it much better than that. However, a few episodes, such as Thor being an only child was the weakest out of all of them, and Killmonger saves Tony ""in this where nobody was smart enough to make good decisions"" It is safe to assume they did the stories excellently and different. Some could have been a bit better with the story. But frankly, I enjoyed the series. I hope they don't do that last episode ever again because this show is supposed to be an anthology and not a series. I am pumped to see season 2 because I hope it has more different anthologies rather than leading up to a big series. 10/10.","What If is a series of stories that would play differently when you have a story.

368,"This series opens new doors for the MCU's future potential. There has been animated Marvel series before, but those are off-brand, non-canonical versions with their own plots. This series relies on the movies. It is a unique journey that explores different scenarios based on the canonical movie events. This, in itself, makes for good entertainment, especially for those who have watched the movies over and over. If you are still not impressed, perhaps you will change your mind knowing ninety percent of the MCU actors reprise their role for this animation (Rest In Peace, Chadwick Boseman). This is something that is extremely rare in adaptations.","This series opens new doors for the MCU's future potential.

The first episode was the best attempt at it, one single change, one single choice, creates an alternate timeline and alternate story.

Hope wasn't an agent pre-avengers therefore couldn't have been killed, Strange was too arrogant to love Christine pre-accident therefore wouldn't have had this dilemma).

393,"Many wasted, interesting ideas that could've made this the best show ever, yet it was all cliché and, apart from a few moments of shining. I loved alternate Star Lord (not his story, the character), and would've loved to see more of Gamora and Sakaarian Tony and I'm a huge Dr. Strange fan, so I loved everything he was involved in. Notwithstanding these, What If...? Was mediocre at best, but definitely not good. It wasn't horribly bad, but considering the characters and possibilities at Marvel's disposal, this show is nothing but a letdown. I watched it all, hoping for a concept that wasn't just intriguing, but well-executed as well. The Doctor Strange episode came close in my opinion, though it still wasn't great. The last two episodes were full of plotholes, and not in a fun way. Nevertheless, I would have been able to forgive the writers were I to be given a satisfactory ending. I wasn't, naturally.

415,"My son (12 years old, has seen every MCU movie and tv show) and I (grew up on Marvel Comics in the 1980's and 90's) watched Episode 1 together and were highly entertained. The animation has elements of classic comics and is unfussy, with beautiful saturation. It had the impact of 3D, though the look was reminiscent of comic book panels or movie storyboards. And the action was honestly incredible. Much of the story was like a dance, with elaborately choreographed fight scenes, dazzling knock-outs, and soaring moves. (In fact, the dance metaphor is repeatedly referenced in the dialogue) Contrary to many reviewers, we were not bothered by the pace, as the narrative toggled between those quick-pulsed fight scenes and much slower paced exposition. I agree the lip syncing was off in places, but honestly, is that how we have come to judge cartoons these days? Because TBH, that issue is pervasive in huge swaths of animation. My highest critique is that the story was a tad cliche and the handling of the gender/misogyny angle seemed superficial and facile for 2021, but of course the story is set during WWII, so perhaps that was a calculated approach. Anyway, good fun. Any review below 5 stars is disingenuous and cynical.

421,"You should've already know that these episodes aren't fillers as clearly the Watcher says those quotes in the beginning of every episode ""Follow me, on these new vast universes."" This is a continuation after Sylvie opened/exposed the multiverse, but only a few people/android are aware of the other universes at this point. And finally we see the Watcher intervening in Episode 9. If you didn't see it coming, then that's okay but don't be too quick to give something a bad rating when you don't even understand. MCU gets clever and interesting and always finds new ways to keep the fans hyped and entertained. I would give it a 9 because I wish these episodes were longer, but I understand animations and these stories are rightfully quick because we already know most of these stories as each universe tends to follow same story elements before they drift off, and also there's so many Universes that the Watcher need to catch us up with.","You should've already know that these episodes aren't fillers as clearly the Watcher says those quotes in the beginning of every episode ""Follow me, on these new vast universes.""

437,"What If...? Is a show about ruining the MCU. Ive never written a review, but I have loved every entry in this universe, before this Captain Marvel was my least favorite but I at least had positive things to say about it. This show by far takes the place for worst entry in the MCU, and how it got a season 2, nevertheless a 7 on here is lost on me. Every single episode in this besides the first has been about showing us that the heroes were either bad people that the Galaxy would be better off without, or that they're weak. In episode 2 we saw how the Galaxy would be better off without star lord, 3 was showing us that one guy can destroy the Avengers in one day by himself, 4 was showing that strange is not only insane, but weaker than himself, 5 was showing that the heroes never even stood a chance against simple literal zombies, 6 was about how Tony stark is a horrible good for nothing racist(?), 7 was showing that without Loki Thor is VERY dumb for some reason, and 8 and 9 was showing how easy it would be to beat Thanos. This whole show has been without question the worst thing to ever happen to the marvel cinematic universe. The only compliment I have is the great animation. I understand some of these are from the comics but that doesn't change anything. The idea that the heroes are only good enough to save people because they're lucky, isn't very heroic to me, it just shows that they're nothing special, they're just dudes in tights.","What If...?

462,"Now when I think about animated superhero movies and tv-shows, DC is the one that comes to mind because let's just say that Marvel has only had one or two actually good animated tv-shows or movies. The reason I don't make this amazing tv-show a 10/10 is because of the cut of the Gamora episode. I understand when you have to cut something out to keep the final episode release date the same, but maybe they could have used a character from the Zombies episode or Hank Pym from the What if the avengers died episode. This would have made a lot more sense (At least I think) because we only get the tiniest bit of plot with her when the Watcher goes to take her to the fight. Other than this, this series is absolutely stunning. From its stellar animation to its hidden details (like many Marvel movies and tv-shows), this is what you get when you put good animators with great directors and voice actors. My favourite episode has to be 'What if Doctor Strange lost his hands instead of his heart?', the compassion that Benedictine Cumberbatch uses through the performance is mind-boggling, the references to the comic books which make little analysers giggle between themselves and the plot of the watcher and Doctor Strange. What stood out to me was the end where The Watcher nearly interfered which he didn't come close to doing in any other episode (except the last), even though it shows itself through a screen, you can see the tension fizzling between the two god-like beings, not too different from each other. One bound by grief and loss of love while another is chained to watch as planets and universes unfold on top themselves, unable to do anything. This is really solidified at the end of the episode when Doctor Strange is encased in a prison prism of his own making, unable to escape whereas later in the series (in ep 8 exactly) we see Ultron chasing The Watcher through a row of those prism-like shapes. It may seem like the watcher is all-powerful, but he too is trapped like the Doctor in a prison of his own making. He swore an oath to not interfere, he is forced to just watch, unable to leave, but unable to interfere as conflict after conflict flutter between his eyes. Every time a universe kills itself, he must watch and endure the suffering of the inhabitants, knowing he could most likely use his powers to save them, yet chained like an animal. I cannot wait for season 2 and if the quality is anywhere near similar, I will personally make sure I will make another review!!!","Now when I think about animated superhero movies and tv-shows, DC is the one that comes to mind because let's just say that Marvel has only had one or two actually good animated tv-shows or movies.
